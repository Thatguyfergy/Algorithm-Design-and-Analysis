# Project Description
Here is the general description of the project.

## Project 1: Integration of Mergesort & Insertion Sort
Present a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines mergesort and insertion sort. Then compare the performance with different implementations.

## Project 2: The Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
Implement the Dijkstra algorithm with heap and array. Then compare the performance with different implementations.

## Project 3: Dynamic Programming
Design a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the knapsack problem. Then compare the performance with different implementations.
